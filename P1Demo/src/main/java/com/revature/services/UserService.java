/*What is the Service layer?? It's also known as the "Business Logic Layer" because...

    -This is where we do any data processing/error handling that DOESN'T have to do with the DB or HTTP
        -DAO handles DB operations
        -Controller handles HTTP requests/responses
    -EVERYTHING in between should live in the Service layer! */
